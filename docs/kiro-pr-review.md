# Kiro pull request reviewer

The `Kiro PR Review` GitHub Actions workflow runs a read-only Kiro CLI agent when a pull request is opened, reopened, marked ready for review, or updated with new commits. A manual dispatch accepts a pull request number so maintainers can review PRs that existed before the workflow was installed.

## Files

- `.github/workflows/kiro-pr-review.yml` resolves the exact PR revision, keeps trusted automation at the workspace root, checks out untrusted PR code under `review-target/`, invokes Kiro headlessly, and creates or updates one PR comment.
- `.kiro/agents/pr-reviewer.json` limits the agent to repository reads and gives it focused review instructions.
- `.github/scripts/extract-kiro-review.py` extracts the final Markdown response from Kiro's `stream-json` output.

## Required secret

Create a Kiro API key in Kiro account settings, then store it as the repository Actions secret `KIRO_API_KEY`:

```sh
gh secret set KIRO_API_KEY --repo windson/todo-frontend
```

Enter the key when prompted. Do not commit the key or pass it as a command-line argument.

Kiro API keys are Kiro account credentials. AWS IAM access keys cannot be used as `KIRO_API_KEY`.

## Manual review

After the workflow exists on the default branch, review an existing PR with:

```sh
gh workflow run "Kiro PR Review" --repo windson/todo-frontend -f pr_number=1
```

The workflow updates its prior `<!-- kiro-pr-review -->` comment rather than adding duplicate comments after every push.
