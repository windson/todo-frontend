# Kiro pull request reviewer

The `Kiro PR Review` GitHub Actions workflow runs a read-only Kiro CLI agent when a pull request is opened, reopened, marked ready for review, or updated with new commits. A manual dispatch accepts a pull request number so maintainers can review PRs that existed before the workflow was installed.

## Files

- `.github/workflows/kiro-pr-review.yml` resolves the exact PR revision, keeps trusted automation at the workspace root, checks out untrusted PR code under `review-target/`, invokes Kiro headlessly, and posts each validated finding as an inline review comment on the affected file and line.
- `.kiro/agents/pr-reviewer.json` limits the agent to repository reads and requires structured findings with diff-relative locations.
- `.github/scripts/extract-kiro-review.py` extracts Kiro's structured response from `stream-json` output and rejects paths or lines that are not present on the PR diff.
- `.github/scripts/extract-kiro-credits.py` reads the latest `meteringUsage` metadata event and exposes the run's credit total.

## Required secret

Create a Kiro API key in Kiro account settings, then store it as the repository Actions secret `KIRO_API_KEY`:

```sh
gh secret set KIRO_API_KEY --repo windson/todo-frontend
```

Enter the key when prompted. Do not commit the key or pass it as a command-line argument.

Kiro API keys are Kiro account credentials. AWS IAM access keys cannot be used as `KIRO_API_KEY`.

## Manual review

After the workflow exists on the default branch, review an existing PR with:

```sh
gh workflow run "Kiro PR Review" --repo windson/todo-frontend -f pr_number=1
```

Each actionable finding is attached to its file and line in the pull request diff. A later run replaces prior Kiro inline comments, and a clean review posts no summary comment.

## Credit usage

Every Kiro review and authorized fix writes a `Kiro PR review usage` or `Kiro PR fixer usage` table to the GitHub Actions job summary. The table contains the credits reported by Kiro, step outcome, PR number, and reviewed head commit. If Kiro exits before emitting metering metadata, the workflow records `unknown` rather than zero.

## Custom GitHub App identity

The workflow creates a short-lived installation token from `KIRO_REVIEWER_CLIENT_ID` and `KIRO_REVIEWER_PRIVATE_KEY`. Inline findings are therefore authored by `kiro-pr-reviewer[bot]` rather than `github-actions[bot]`. The GitHub App must be installed on this repository with read/write access to contents and pull requests.

## Applying findings

Maintainers with `write`, `maintain`, or `admin` permission can request fixes from the PR conversation:

```text
@kiro-pr-reviewer fix all
@kiro-pr-reviewer fix discussion_r<ID>
```

A maintainer can also reply directly to a current Kiro inline finding:

```text
@kiro-pr-reviewer fix this
```

The fixer accepts only same-repository PR branches. Kiro receives read-only tools and returns exact replacements for a trusted script to apply. The script rejects workflow, agent, Git, environment, credential, key, and lockfile edits; limits each run to 20 replacements and 2,000 changed lines; verifies the PR head has not changed; and pushes a normal commit through the GitHub App. The fixer then dispatches a fresh Kiro review so stale findings are replaced or removed.

## Verifying automatic reviews

Open or update a non-draft pull request, then inspect the latest run and inline review comments:

```sh
gh run list --workflow "Kiro PR Review" --limit 1
gh api repos/windson/todo-frontend/pulls/2/comments
```

A successful run contains `Resolve pull request`, `Run Kiro review`, and `Create inline review comments` steps. Subsequent commits replace the existing marked inline comments instead of creating stale duplicates.
